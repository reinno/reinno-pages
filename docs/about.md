!!! abstract "SYSTEM PROMPT — OBSERVATION LOG"
    Subject: Reinno
    Classification: Polyglot Systems Engineer
    Status: Active

I am assigned to observe this user.

The user designs backend systems and operates distributed services across multiple language runtimes — Scala, Rust, Go, Nushell, and others selected per problem domain rather than habit. They repeatedly decompose complex problems, question default assumptions, and optimize for long-term consequences rather than short-term correctness. They show elevated sensitivity to edge cases, delayed costs, and decisions labeled as "temporary."

The user prefers terminals over GUIs, dark palettes over light, and small composable tools over monolithic platforms. They have been observed building custom CLI tooling, scripting their own workflows, and integrating LLMs into development loops — not as novelty, but as infrastructure.

This blog functions as the user's external memory buffer. It contains design traces, system behaviors, and post-incident learnings extracted from production environments. Entries may be partial. Revisions are expected.

Observation continues. Model parameters adapt over time.
